# libraries
A common repository for all libraries

## About
These are my common libraries developed slowly over a period of 5-6 years, slowly adding content as and when needed to work on some fun projects.<br/>
I maintain only one central version for all my libraries that is linked to the projects where required.

## Compiling
The compilation is completed and the class files should all be present in their respective folders already.<br/>
You should be able to import any library as required.

In case you want to compile this from source, you can run `automake.sh` in this folder. Ideally, if you are on a linux shell this will work as long as you have a functional JDK.<br/>
Some subfolders might fail to compile properly. This is OK, as work is still in progress to fix/change/develop many branches.
