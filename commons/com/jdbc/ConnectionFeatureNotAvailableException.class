\b rmSetConnectionBaseHeight(int connectionID, float width): Sets the base height of a connection.\par
rmSetConnectionCoherence(int connectionID, float width): Sets area coherence (0-1).\par
rmSetConnectionWarnFailure(int connectionID, bool warn): Sets whether a connection warns on failure.\par
rmSetConnectionHeightBlend(int connectionID, float width): Sets how smoothly connection height blends into s
